# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Keycloak Connector for React** in less than 15 minutes.

## Getting Started

Get started by adding the following packages to an existing application.

  #### Frontend - React App
  ```sh
  npm i @dapperduckling/keycloak-connector-react
  ```

  #### Backend - NodeJs Server
  ```sh
  npm i @dapperduckling/keycloak-connector-server 
  ```

[//]: # (todo: Update this with a nodejs in browser option)
Or **try Keycloak Connector immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:

## Preparing the backend with Express

[//]: # (update this with a link to the supported servers page)
_Using a different server? See our [other supported servers.](/supported-servers)_

Keycloak connector server is an auth middleware that sits between end-user requests and your secure routes.  




The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
